Arduino / C++ files to simplify interfacing with the DFRobot Tank (v2.3)

##Use

1. Download and place this repository inside **/sketchbook/libraries**
2. Open the Arduino IDE
3. Select Sketch -> Import Library -> dfr_tank

Try the example program to see how the library is used.  The example program is located in sketchbook/libraries/dfr_tank/examples/

**Note that this library uses digital pins 4, 5, 6, and 7 to control the tank motors, so they cannot be used elsewhere**
